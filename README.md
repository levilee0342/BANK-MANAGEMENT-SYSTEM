## Key Features

### Database Distribution

The **NGANHANG** database is distributed across three servers to optimize performance and ensure branch-specific data accessibility:
1. **Server 1**: Stores customer data and transactions for the **BENTHANH** branch.
2. **Server 2**: Stores customer data and transactions for the **TANDINH** branch.
3. **Server 3**: Consolidates customer data from both branches for overarching operations.

> **Note**: Each customer registers with only one branch but can own multiple accounts across branches.
